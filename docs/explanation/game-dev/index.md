## Getting Started

**New to BMGD?** Start here:

- **[Quick Start Guide](../../tutorials/getting-started/quick-start-bmgd.md)** - Get started building your first game
  - Installation and setup
  - Understanding the game development phases
  - Running your first workflows
  - Agent-based development flow

**Quick Path:** Install BMGD module → Game Brief → GDD → Architecture → Build

---

## Core Documentation

- **[Game Types Guide](./game-types.md)** - Selecting and using game type templates (24 supported types)
- **[BMGD vs BMM](./bmgd-vs-bmm.md)** - Understanding the differences

## Game Development Phases

BMGD follows four phases aligned with game development:

### Phase 1: Preproduction
- **Brainstorm Game** - Ideation with game-specific techniques
- **Game Brief** - Capture vision, market, and fundamentals

### Phase 2: Design
- **GDD (Game Design Document)** - Comprehensive game design
- **Narrative Design** - Story, characters, world (for story-driven games)

### Phase 3: Technical
- **Game Architecture** - Engine, systems, patterns, structure

### Phase 4: Production
- **Sprint Planning** - Epic and story management
- **Story Development** - Implementation workflow
- **Code Review** - Quality assurance
- **Testing** - Automated tests, playtesting, performance
- **Retrospective** - Continuous improvement

## Choose Your Path

### I need to...

**Start a new game project**
→ Start with [Quick Start Guide](../../tutorials/getting-started/quick-start-bmgd.md)
→ Run `brainstorm-game` for ideation
→ Create a Game Brief with `create-brief`

**Design my game**
→ Create a GDD with `create-gdd`
→ If story-heavy, add Narrative Design with `create-narrative`

**Plan the technical architecture**
→ Run `create-architecture` with the Game Architect

**Build my game**
→ Use Phase 4 production workflows
→ Follow the sprint-based development cycle

**Quickly test an idea**
→ Use [Quick-Flow](../../how-to/workflows/bmgd-quick-flow.md) for rapid prototyping
