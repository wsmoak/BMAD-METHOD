Quick answers to common questions about BMad Method workflows and phases.

---

## Q: What's the difference between workflow-status and workflow-init?

**A:**

- **workflow-status:** Checks existing status and tells you what's next (use when continuing work)
- **workflow-init:** Creates new status file and sets up project (use when starting new project)

If status file exists, use workflow-status. If not, use workflow-init.

## Q: Can I skip Phase 1 (Analysis)?

**A:** Yes! Phase 1 is optional for all levels, though recommended for complex projects. Skip if:

- Requirements are clear
- No research needed
- Time-sensitive work
- Small changes (Level 0-1)

## Q: When is Phase 3 (Architecture) required?

**A:**

- **Level 0-1:** Never (skip entirely)
- **Level 2:** Optional (only if system design needed)
- **Level 3-4:** Required (comprehensive architecture mandatory)

## Q: What happens if I skip a recommended workflow?

**A:** Nothing breaks! Workflows are guidance, not enforcement. However, skipping recommended workflows (like architecture for Level 3) may cause:

- Integration issues during implementation
- Rework due to poor planning
- Conflicting design decisions
- Longer development time overall

## Q: How do I know when Phase 3 is complete and I can start Phase 4?

**A:** For Level 3-4, run the implementation-readiness workflow. It validates PRD + Architecture + Epics + UX (optional) are aligned before implementation. Pass the gate check = ready for Phase 4.

## Q: Can I run workflows in parallel or do they have to be sequential?

**A:** Most workflows must be sequential within a phase:

- Phase 1: brainstorm → research → product-brief (optional order)
- Phase 2: PRD must complete before moving forward
- Phase 3: architecture → epics+stories → implementation-readiness (sequential)
- Phase 4: Stories within an epic should generally be sequential, but stories in different epics can be parallel if you have capacity
