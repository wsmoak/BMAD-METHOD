## Prerequisites

- BMad Method installed
- Analyst agent available

---

## Steps

### 1. Load the Analyst Agent

Start a fresh chat and load the Analyst agent.

### 2. Run the Research Workflow

```
*research
```

### 3. Choose Research Type

Select the type of research you need:

| Type            | Purpose                                                | Use When                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **market**      | TAM/SAM/SOM, competitive analysis                      | Need market viability validation    |
