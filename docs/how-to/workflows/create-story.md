description: How to create implementation-ready stories from epic backlog
---


Use the `create-story` workflow to prepare the next story from the epic backlog for implementation.

---

## When to Use This

- Before implementing each story
- When moving to the next story in an epic
- After sprint-planning has been run

---

## Prerequisites

- BMad Method installed
- SM (Scrum Master) agent available
- Sprint-status.yaml created by sprint-planning
- Architecture and PRD available for context

---

## Steps

### 1. Load the SM Agent

Start a fresh chat and load the SM (Scrum Master) agent.

### 2. Run the Workflow

```
*create-story
```

### 3. Specify the Story

The agent will:
- Read the sprint-status.yaml
- Identify the next story to work on
- Or let you specify a particular story

### 4. Review the Story File

The agent creates a comprehensive story file ready for development.

## What You Get

A `story-[slug].md` file containing:

- Story objective and scope
- Acceptance criteria (specific, testable)
- Technical implementation notes
- References to architecture decisions
- Dependencies on other stories
- Definition of Done

---

## Story Content Sources

The create-story workflow pulls from:

- **PRD** - Requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Architecture** - Technical approach and ADRs
- **Epic file** - Story context and dependencies
- **Existing code** - Patterns to follow (brownfield)

---

## Example Output

```markdown

## Objective
Implement email verification flow for new user registrations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User receives verification email within 30 seconds
- [ ] Email contains unique verification link
- [ ] Link expires after 24 hours
- [ ] User can request new verification email

## Technical Notes
- Use SendGrid API per ADR-003
- Store verification tokens in Redis per architecture
- Follow existing email template patterns in /templates

## Dependencies
- Story 1.1 (User Registration) - DONE ✅

## Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria pass
- Tests written and passing
- Code review approved
```

---

## Tips

- Complete one story before creating the next
- Ensure dependencies are marked DONE before starting
- Review technical notes for architecture alignment
- Use the story file as context for dev-story
