Start with any agent that supports party mode (most do).

### 2. Start Party Mode

```

```

Or use the full path:
```
/bmad:core:workflows:party-mode

### 3. Introduce Your Topic

Present a topic or question for the group to discuss:

```
I'm trying to decide between a monolithic architecture
and microservices for our new platform.
```

### 4. Engage with the Discussion

The facilitator will:
- Select 2-3 most relevant agents based on expertise
