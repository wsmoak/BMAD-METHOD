---


Use the `brainstorm-project` workflow to explore solution approaches through parallel ideation tracks.

---

## When to Use This

- Very vague or seed kernel of an idea that needs exploration
- Consider alternatives or enhancements to an idea
- See your idea from different angles and viewpoints
- No idea what you want to build, but want to find some inspiration

---

## Prerequisites

- BMad Method installed
- Analyst agent available

---

## Steps

### 1. Load the Analyst Agent

Start a fresh chat and load the Analyst agent.

### 2. Run the Brainstorm Workflow

```
*brainstorm-project
```

### 3. Describe Your Idea

Tell the agent about your project idea, even if it's vague:

- "I want to build something that helps developers manage their context"
- "I have a game idea about resource management"
- "I need a tool for my team but I'm not sure what exactly"

### 4. Explore the Tracks

The workflow generates solution approaches through parallel ideation tracks:

- **Architecture track** - Technical approaches and patterns
- **UX track** - User experience possibilities
- **Integration track** - How it connects with other systems
- **Value track** - Business value and differentiation

### 5. Evaluate Options

Review the generated options with rationale for each approach.

---

## What You Get

- Multiple solution approaches with trade-offs
- Different architectural options
- UX and integration considerations
- Clear rationale for each direction

---

## Next Steps

After brainstorming:

1. **Research** - Validate ideas with market/technical research
2. **Product Brief** - Capture strategic vision
3. **PRD** - Move to formal planning

---

## Tips

- Don't worry about having a fully formed idea
- Let the agent guide the exploration
- Consider multiple tracks before deciding
- Use outputs as input for product-brief workflow
