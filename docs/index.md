BMad (**B**uild **M**ore, **A**rchitect **D**reams) is an AI-driven development framework that helps you build software faster and smarter. It provides specialized AI agents, guided workflows, and intelligent planning that adapts to your project's complexity—whether you're fixing a bug or building an enterprise platform.

If you're comfortable working with AI coding assistants like Claude, Cursor, or GitHub Copilot, you're ready to get started.

## How to Use These Docs

These docs are organized into four sections based on what you're trying to do:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **[Tutorials](./tutorials/index.md)** | Learning-oriented. Step-by-step guides that walk you through building something. Start here if you're new. |
| **[How-To Guides](./how-to/index.md)** | Task-oriented. Practical guides for solving specific problems. "How do I customize an agent?" lives here. |
| **[Explanation](./explanation/index.md)** | Understanding-oriented. Deep dives into concepts and architecture. Read when you want to know *why*. |
| **[Reference](./reference/index.md)** | Information-oriented. Technical specifications for agents, workflows, and configuration. |

## What You'll Need

BMad works with any AI coding assistant that supports custom system prompts or project context. Popular options include:

- **[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com)** — Anthropic's CLI tool (recommended)
- **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh)** — AI-first code editor
- **[Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)** — Codeium's AI IDE
- **[Roo Code](https://roocode.com)** — VS Code extension

You should be comfortable with basic software development concepts like version control, project structure, and agile workflows. No prior experience with BMad-style agent systems is required—that's what these docs are for.
