## AI-Driven Agile Development That Scales From Bug Fixes to Enterprise

**Build More, Architect Dreams** (BMAD) with **21 specialized AI agents** across 4 official modules, and **50+ guided workflows** that adapt to your project's complexity—from quick bug fixes to enterprise platforms, and new step file workflows that allow for incredibly long workflows to stay on the rails longer than ever before!

Additionally - when we say 'Build More, Architect Dreams' - we mean it! The BMad Builder has landed, and now as of Alpha.15 is fully supported in the installation flow via NPX - custom stand along agents, workflows and the modules of your dreams! The community forge will soon open, endless possibility awaits!

> **🚀 v6 is a MASSIVE upgrade from v4!** Complete architectural overhaul, scale-adaptive intelligence, visual workflows, and the powerful BMad Core framework. v4 users: this changes everything. [See what's new →](#whats-new-in-v6)

> **📌 v6 Alpha Status:** Near-beta quality with vastly improved stability. Documentation is being finalized. New videos coming soon to [BMadCode YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@BMadCode).

## 🎯 Why BMad Method?

Unlike generic AI coding assistants, BMad Method provides **structured, battle-tested workflows** powered by specialized agents who understand agile development. Each agent has deep domain expertise—from product management to architecture to testing—working together seamlessly.

**✨ Key Benefits:**

- **Scale-Adaptive Intelligence** - Automatically adjusts planning depth from bug fixes to enterprise systems
- **Complete Development Lifecycle** - Analysis → Planning → Architecture → Implementation
- **Specialized Expertise** - 19 agents with specific roles (PM, Architect, Developer, UX Designer, etc.)
- **Proven Methodologies** - Built on agile best practices with AI amplification
- **IDE Integration** - Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code

## 🏗️ The Power of BMad Core

**BMad Method** is actually a sophisticated module built on top of **BMad Core** (**C**ollaboration **O**ptimized **R**eflection **E**ngine). This revolutionary architecture means:

- **BMad Core** provides the universal framework for human-AI collaboration
- **BMad Method** leverages Core to deliver agile development workflows
- **BMad Builder** lets YOU create custom modules as powerful as BMad Method itself

With **BMad Builder**, you can architect both simple agents and vastly complex domain-specific modules (legal, medical, finance, education, creative) that will soon be sharable in an **official community marketplace**. Imagine building and sharing your own specialized AI team!

## 🚀 Get Started in 3 Steps

### 1. Install BMad Method

```bash
# Install v6 Alpha (recommended)
npx bmad-method@alpha install

# Or stable v4 for production
npx bmad-method install
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project

Load any agent in your IDE and run:

```
*workflow-init
```

This analyzes your project and recommends the right workflow track.

### 3. Choose Your Track

BMad Method adapts to your needs with three intelligent tracks:

| Track              | Use For                   | Planning                | Time to Start |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| **⚡ Quick Flow**  | Bug fixes, small features | Tech spec only          | < 5 minutes   |
| **📋 BMad Method** | Products, platforms       | PRD + Architecture + UX | < 15 minutes  |
| **🏢 Enterprise**  | Compliance, scale         | Full governance suite   | < 30 minutes  |

> **Not sure?** Run `*workflow-init` and let BMad analyze your project goal.

## 🔄 How It Works: 4-Phase Methodology

BMad Method guides you through a proven development lifecycle:

1. **📊 Analysis** (Optional) - Brainstorm, research, and explore solutions
2. **📝 Planning** - Create PRDs, tech specs, or game design documents
3. **🏗️ Solutioning** - Design architecture, UX, and technical approach
4. **⚡ Implementation** - Story-driven development with continuous validation

Each phase has specialized workflows and agents working together to deliver exceptional results.

## 🤖 Meet Your Team

**12 Specialized Agents** working in concert:

| Development | Architecture   | Product       | Leadership     |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Developer   | Architect      | PM            | Scrum Master   |
| UX Designer | Test Architect | Analyst       | BMad Master    |
| Tech Writer | Game Architect | Game Designer | Game Developer |

**Test Architect** integrates with `@seontechnologies/playwright-utils` for production-ready fixture-based utilities.

Each agent brings deep expertise and can be customized to match your team's style.
